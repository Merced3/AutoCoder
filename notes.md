# Next steps:

### 1) Perfect the 'debugger_agent'
- **Debug Larger Pieces of Code:** This ensures the debugger can handle real-world projects, which often involve files with hundreds or thousands of lines. **It's foundational:** Once this is working, it will help during the training process for GitHub code fixes because you'll have a more robust debugging environment.
- **Train the Debugger on GitHub Code Fixes:** This improves the agent’s ability to suggest fixes. However, it relies on the foundational debugging infrastructure. If the agent can’t debug larger codebases yet, its training won’t be as impactful.

### 2) Make the 'coder_agent'
### 3) Make the 'something_agent'
